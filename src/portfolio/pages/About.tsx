                My name is John Desiderio, and I am an aspiring software engineer 
                open to all opportunities. I am originally from Atlanta, 
                GA, but I moved to Statesboro, GA when I was nine. Growing 
                up, I played soccer and tried my hardest never to miss 
                an opportunity to kick a ball. Likewise, I enjoy watching 
                soccer, but my sports interests are not limited to soccer. 
                I also love to watch college football and Formula 1. After 
                graduating high school, I attended the University of Georgia 
                and spent 4.5 years in Athens. I graduated with a Bachelor 
                of Science in computer science and a Bachelor of Arts in 
                English. Now, I am looking for a position that would allow 
                me to enter the workforce and work on the new, cool, and 
                exciting technology. I maintain my web apps in my free time, 
                but if I am away from the screen, I prefer to read or spend 
                time with friends. If you want to connect with me on 
                Goodreads, you should click the
