                    Welcome to my portfolio! My name is John Desiderio, 
                    and I am a recent graduate from the University of Georgia. 
                    I am a junior software engineer looking for an opportunity 
                    to prove my worth and contribute to meaningful projects that 
                    make a difference. I have experience working on different web 
                    projects and with new technologies. My interest is in full-stack 
                    development, which is the area I want to grow the most as a 
                    software engineer. Click over to the projects section and look 
                    at the projects section to learn more about the different things 
                    I have worked on and the current projects I want to finish!
